## Customization

Customize the content with your personal information, work experience, education, and any other relevant details following the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) protocol. The official documentation can be found [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).

### Styling

Open the [Palette.js](src/components/themes/Palette.js) file in order to specify your prefered colororing, fonts and MUI components. Customize the theme with your personal preferences. The official documentation for the Material-UI theme can be found [here](https://mui.com/customization/theming/). The official documentation for the Material-UI components can be found [here](https://mui.com/material-ui/). If you want to customize the gradient filling for some icons, you can do so in the [GradientSVG.js](src/components/utils/GradientSVG.js) file, by replacing it with a new svg component.
